//! Event-pump surface — wakes the main thread when a tokio worker
//! (or other background thread) has produced an event that user
//! callbacks need to fire on.
//!
//! # Why
//!
//! Wrappers that expose `.on('event', cb)` semantics — `ws`, `http`,
//! `net`, `fastify` request/reply, `events.EventEmitter` (already
//! ported but in-process so no notify needed) — produce events on
//! tokio worker threads but must invoke user callbacks on the main
//! thread (perry-runtime's GC, NaN-boxing tag visibility, and
//! single-threaded JS semantics all assume main-thread callback
//! execution).
//!
//! The flow:
//!
//! ```text
//! tokio worker:        main thread:
//!   receive event        wait_for_event() →
//!   push onto queue          (woken by notify)
//!   notify_main_thread() → process_pending() drains queue
//!                          → JsClosure::call0/1/N for each listener
//! ```
//!
//! Wrappers manage their own per-module pending-events queue
//! (`Mutex<Vec<MyEvent>>` typical). They expose a
//! `js_<name>_process_pending() -> i32` extern that perry-codegen's
//! event-loop pump calls every tick to drain. The queue's producer
//! side calls `notify_main_thread()` after pushing so the main loop
//! wakes promptly instead of waiting on the 1-second heartbeat cap.
//!
//! # Today's surface (v0.5.x)
//!
//! Just `notify_main_thread`. The dispatch — `js_<name>_process_pending`
//! / `js_<name>_has_pending` — is wrapper-specific and doesn't need a
//! perry-ffi entry; codegen knows about each wrapper's tick symbols by
//! name, the same way it does for perry-stdlib's pumps (cron, http, ws,
//! readline, …).
